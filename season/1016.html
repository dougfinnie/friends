    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Joey</span> All right, all right, all right, let's
      play one more time, ok? And remember, if I win
      <em>you do not move to Paris.</em>
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Rachel</span> Ok! Can't believe I'm risking this
      again, but you're on! All right Joe, you remember the rules! Heads I win,
      tails you lose.
    </p>
    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Joey</span> Just flip!</p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Rachel</span> (she flips the coin) Ha, tails!
    </p>
    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Joey</span> Damnit!</p>
    <p class="direction">(Chandler and Monica enter the room)</p>
    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Chandler</span> Hey!</p>
    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Joey</span> Hey!</p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> So we thought we'd throw you
      little going away party around seven.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Rachel</span> Oh, that sounds good!
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> Hey, Rach, you're leaving tomorrow,
      shouldn't you be packing?
    </p>
    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Rachel</span> It's all done!</p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> Oh, yeah, right! And after I took a
      shower this morning I just threw my towel on the floor! Oh God, it hurts
      to even joke about it.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Rachel</span> I know... Honey, seriously, I did it
      all. The luggage that I'm taking is in the bedroom, this is Emma's Paris
      stuff, these are the boxes that I'm having shipped, and that's the
      sandwich that I made for the plane...
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> Ok, so you've done some good work!
      (pause) What about your carry-ons?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Rachel</span> Oh, well. Everything that I need
      (she takes her bag) is in here and my travel documents are on the counter
      organized in the order that I will be needing them.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> Oh my God! I have nothing left to
      teach you! (they hug)
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> Where's your passport?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Rachel</span> It should be right next to my plane
      ticket.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> Well, it's not.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Rachel</span> What? Maybe I put it in here (she
      opens her bag). Oh, oh, it's not in there! Oh, no! I must have packed it
      in one of these boxes!
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> Here, let me help you. (they both
      start opening boxes)
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Rachel</span> Shoot. Oh, I can't believe I did
      this!
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> (to Joey): At what point did it
      stop being funny that I took her passport?

      [Scene: Monica's apartment. Monica and Erica are talking about the baby,
      and Monica is rubbing Erica's tummy.]
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> Oh, wow, can you believe you're like
      three weeks away?
    </p>
    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Erica</span> I know.</p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> You don't mind me touching your
      belly, do you?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Erica</span> No, I don't mind you touching my
      belly, but right now your hand is kind of blocking the part where the baby
      is gonna come out.
    </p>
    <p class="direction">
      (She takes her hand off Erica. Ross enters the room)
    </p>
    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Ross</span> Hey!</p>
    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Erica</span> Hi.</p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> Hey Erica, welcome back to town!
      (pause) Wow, look how big you've gotten.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Erica</span> That's because I'm pregnant!
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> Right, no, I understand.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Erica</span> Oh, ok. I'm just always afraid that
      people think I'm just fat with big breasts.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> No, no, I knew (he stares at her
      breasts).
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> (to Ross): Okay, well, stop staring
      at them.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> She brought them up! (pause) I didn't
      realize you were coming back so soon!
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Erica</span> Hey, well, in a couple of weeks I
      won't be able to travel.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> Yeah, and I wanted her to get to
      know the doctors and get settled into the hotel.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> Hotel? Why isn't she staying with you
      guys?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> Because we're moving in a couple of
      days and it just didn't make sense.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Erica</span> Plus hotels are fun! My room has this
      little fridge full of free snacks!
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> Erica, those things aren't free. In
      fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any consumer product...
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> Ross! She's giving us her baby. She
      can eat <em>you</em> if she wants.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Erica</span> (standing up): I'll be right back.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> Oh man, I can't believe you guys are
      leaving this place.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> Oh, I know. I know. Hey, you know,
      you can take it if you want! The lease is still in Nana's name.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> No, no. This will always be
      <em>your</em> place. It would be too sad. Plus, how much a month does it
      cost to feed Joey?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> Yeah, it takes two incomes.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> Hey, is Chandler here? We talked about
      catching a movie.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> Oh, no. He doesn't have time for
      that. But if you want, you can go help him and Joey pack up the guest
      room.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> Mhm, (he balance things) packing -
      sexy cheerleader comedy.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> Mhm, helpful brother - creepy loner
      at teen movie.

      <span class="character">Ross</span> What are you guys doing?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Joey</span> Try it, I can't feel a thing! (Ross

      <span class="character">Monica</span> (enters the room) Are, are you
      kidding? <em>This</em> is packing?

      <span class="character">Chandler</span> Jumping on the bed?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> All right, Rachel's party is in a
      couple of hours and there's a lot to do. Now, Ross, you got Geller blood,
      you're in charge of these yahoos!
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> You got it! (Monica leaves, Ross
      closes the door). All right, she's right, we gotta get serious. (He grabs
      a bag of styrofoam peanuts) Let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and
      kick him!
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> No, no, no, guys. She's right. We
      should get to work. I'll take stuff out of the closet, Joey you pack 'em
      and Ross you re-pack whatever Joey packs.
    </p>
    <p class="direction">(Joey takes the bubble wrap off his head)</p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Joey</span> You guys hear a ringing?

      <span class="character">Chandler</span> (holding a pair of furry
      handcuffs) What the hell is this?

      <span class="character">Joey</span> Hey! Handcuffs! And fur line, nice! I
      didn't know you guys had it in ya!
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> Chandler, you don't have a sister so
      you can't understand how much this bums me out.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> I didn't know Monica had these!
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Joey</span> Mhm, maybe she used them with another
      boyfriend. Maybe Richard!
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> Why would she use them with
      Richard and not me? I can be kinky! I once did a naked dance for her...
      <em>with scarves!</em>
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> Bumming hard, guys, bumming hard.

      <span class="character">Monica</span> Hey! Where's Mike?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Phoebe</span> Oh, he has a gig. I kinda like being
      married to a rock star, you know. My husband has a gig.

      <span class="character">Ross</span> Yeah? Yeah, where is it?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Phoebe</span> Oh, he's playing organ for a
      children's roller-skating party.

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Phoebe</span> (watching the food on the table)
      Wow, this is quite a spread! (pause) What is all this stuff?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> Well, I thought this would be a
      great opportunity to use up all the food that I don't want to move to the
      new house with me! So, enjoy: smoke oyster casserole with a breakfast
      cereal crust, kidney beans in their own juices, and for dessert, a
      questionable orange.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Joey</span> (entering the room) Hey.

      over in a second.
    </p>
    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Ross</span> Great.</p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Joey</span> Now it just hit her that she's leaving
      and she's kind of emotional so no one say anything to set her off, ok?

    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Monica</span> Yeah.</p>

      fine.

      <span class="character">Monica</span> Come here, I'll make you a drink.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> Oh, man! I can't believe she's
      actually leaving. How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> I know, she's been such a big part
      of my life. And it feels like when Melrose Place got cancelled. (Ross and
      Joey looks puzzled) I mean... oh, forget it. I miss Melrose Place!
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Joey</span> (to Ross) You know, I had a chance to
      stop her too!
    </p>
    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Ross</span> Yeah?</p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Joey</span> Who loses fifty seven coin tosses in a
      row? Head she wins, tails I lose. (he stops and starts realizing
      something) Wait a minute...

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Joey</span> I forgot to pick up my dry cleaning!

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Rachel</span> You guys are gonna come and visit
      me, right?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Phoebe</span> Yes! You know, in six months the
      Statute of Limitations runs out and I can travel internationally again!
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Rachel</span> I'm gonna miss you so much.

    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Phoebe</span> I know.</p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Rachel</span> You know what? Uhm, I have some
      goodbye stuff that I wanted to say to each of you and I was gonna save it
      until the end of the night, but come here (they go into the guest room).
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> Hey, what do you think they're doing
      in there?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Joey</span> Huh, if I had to guess I'd say Rachel
      is putting on the bubble wrap and Phoebe is doing the punching.

      to start.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Phoebe</span> Ok well, before you do, I know we
      weren't supposed to get you going away presents, (she takes something out
      from her pocket) but I do have something for you.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Rachel</span> Oh, oh. (she's holding the present,
      a transparent bag with a white stick in it). What is this?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Phoebe</span> It's a cotton swab with a bit of my
      saliva on it, so that if they perfect the cloning process while you are
      over there, you can use the DNA to create your own Pheebs!
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Rachel</span> I'm gonna throw this away, but thank
      you so much for the gesture!

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> Chandler? I was just in our bedroom
      and I found these (she holds the furry handcuffs) on my pillow.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> Oh, yes. I decided to leave these
      out for you in case Richard stops by and you wanna engage on a little
      light bondage and moustache play!

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> What are you talking about? These
      aren't mine.
    </p>

      <span class="character">Chandler</span> Oh yeah, right! Good luck getting
      another scarf dance from me!
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> That would be a
      <em>terrible</em> punishment. But, I'm serious, I've never seen these
      before.

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> Really? Then what are they doing
      in our guestroom?
