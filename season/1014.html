      <span class="character">Mike</span> (raising his glass) Thank you guys for
      having us over.
    </p>

      <span class="character">Phoebe</span> Oh! Yeah, this is fun, couples
      night.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> Yeah, I don't know why we hang out
      with married couples more often.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> Well, because every time we do, you
      make jokes about swinging and scare them away.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> You mean that Portuguese couple?
      Yeah, like you wouldn't have done it. (she shrugs)

      <span class="character">Ross</span> Oh, well, er, I already ate, but
      sure...! (they all look at each other when Ross grabs a plate) Guess what
      happened at work today...

      <span class="character">Ross</span> Try sixty-five million years ago, and
      then try sssshhhhhh.... My tenure review board met today and I hear it's
      looking <em>really</em> good.
    </p>
    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Phoebe</span> Wow!</p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> Yeah. Do you have any idea what this
      means in academic circles, uh? I am gonna get <em>laid</em>.

      <span class="character">Phoebe</span> Hey Mon? Was it weird changing your
      name to Geller-Bing?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> No, no. It felt nice to acknowledge
      this. (pats Chandler on his leg)

      <span class="character">Phoebe</span> Where did you go to do it?

      <span class="character">Chandler</span> YOU NEVER DID IT!
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> I'm sorry. It's just the idea of
      being an official Bing.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> Hey! I will have you know that...
      aah, who am I kidding. Let's call the kid Geller and let Bing die with me.

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Mike</span> (walks to the couch with coffee for
      Phoebe) Here you go.

      take your name?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Mike</span> Oh, it's just... It's up to you. It's
      your name. You've got to live with it.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Phoebe</span> All right, let's see, call me mrs

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> Hey Joe! We've got a couple of
      things we've got to check out at the new house. You want to come with us?
    </p>
    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Joey</span> No, thank you.</p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> All right. I know you're not happy
      about us moving, but you're the only one who hasn't seen the house.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> Yeah, come with us. You'll see how
      close it is to the city.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Joey</span> But no, it's not close. You said it
      was in escrow? I couldn't even find it on the map.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> Joey, please come. It would mean so
      much to us.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Joey</span> You know what? You are my friends, I
      wanna be supportive, I will come with you. SHOTGUN!

    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Chandler</span> Damn it.</p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> See you guys later.

    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Phoebe</span> Okay!</p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> (to Joey) I'll pick you up at
      eleven. So glad you're coming.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Phoebe</span> Good for you. That was really
      mature.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Joey</span> What? No, the only reason I'm going to
      their <em>stupid</em> new house, is so I can point out everything that's
      wrong with it, so they don't move. I'm gonna make them stay here.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Mike</span> You're a strange kind of grown-up.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Phoebe</span> Joey, you can't make someone do
      something they don't want to do. Believe me, there's something I've been
      trying to get Mike to do in bed and there's... he's just...
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Mike</span> Woo-wo-hey-hey-hey... Can we not talk
      about that right now?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Phoebe</span> All right, <em>prude</em>... Look,
      Monica and Chandler really love this house. You are not gonna talk them
      into staying here.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Joey</span> Hey, hey... I can convince people to
      do anything, you know. I bet I can even get Mike to do that
      &quot;thing&quot;. What is it?
