    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Phoebe</span> Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for
      a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the
      rain-forest...And bigger boobs!
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler,
      what about you?
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> Uh, if I were omnipotent for a
      day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever.

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> I cannot sleep in a public place.

      <span class="character">Phoebe</span> My grandmother has this new
      boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So
      they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're
      having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are!
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> Well, if you want, you can stay with
      Rachel and me tonight.

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> So, I'm guessing you had an extra

      consummated our physical relationship. (Joey is puzzled.) Sex. ..You know
      what, I-I'd better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and
      think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.

      <span class="character">Phoebe</span> I remember the day I got my first

      killed.

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> Wow, you worked in a mine?

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Rachel</span> God, isn't this exciting? I earned
      this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was
      totally&#151;(opens envelope)&#151;not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he
      getting all my money? I mean, what- Chandler, look at that.

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Rachel</span> They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay..
      they wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA
      guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or
      getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee! And it's
      not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell
      them I'm okay, okay?

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Phoebe</span> Yeah, right! See, he gave up
      something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and
      there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities
      and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in
      <strong>the</strong> Village..
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Rachel</span> Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave
