      <span class="character">Phoebe</span> (entering) Hi guys!
    </p>

    <p class="speech"><span class="character">All</span> Hey, Pheebs! Hi!</p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Phoebe</span> Um, not so good. He walked me to the
      subway and said 'We should do this again!'
    </p>

    <p class="speech"><span class="character">All</span> Ohh. Ouch.</p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Rachel</span> What? He said 'we should do it
      again', that's good, right?
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We
      should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.
    </p>

    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Rachel</span> Since when?</p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Joey</span> Since always. It's like dating
      language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> Or 'You're such a nice guy' means
      'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them
      to you'.
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Phoebe</span> Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we
      should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Rachel</span> And everybody knows this?
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Joey</span> Yeah. Cushions the blow.
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> Yeah, it's like when you're a kid,
      and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to
      live on some farm.
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> That's funny, that, no, because, uh,
      our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.
    </p>

    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Monica</span> Uh, Ross.</p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in
      Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had
      horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my
      God, Chi Chi!

      [Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is helping Joey rehearse for a
      part.]
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> &quot;So how does it feel knowing
      you're about to die?&quot;
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Joey</span> &quot;Warden, in five minutes my pain
      will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an
      honest man to die.&quot;
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> Hey, that was really good!
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Joey</span> Thanks! Let's keep going.
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> Okay. &quot;So. Whaddya want from
      me, Damone, huh?&quot;
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Joey</span> &quot;I just wanna go back to my cell.
      'Cause in my cell, I can smoke.&quot;
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> &quot;Smoke away.&quot;
    </p>

    <p class="direction">
      (Joey takes out a pack of cigarettes and a lighter. He fumbles and drops
      the lighter. Then he lights a cigarett, takes a drag, and coughs.)
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> I think this is probably why
      Damone smokes in his cell alone.
    </p>

    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Joey</span> What?</p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> Relax your hand!
    </p>

    <p class="direction">(Joey lets his wrist go limp.)</p>

    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Chandler</span> Not so much!</p>

    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Joey</span> Whoah!</p>

    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Chandler</span> Hey!</p>

    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Joey</span> Hey!</p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> Alright, now try taking a puff.
    </p>

    <p class="direction">(Joey tries and visibly winces.)</p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Joey</span> No no no, I am not giving you a
      cigarette.
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you
      wanna get this part, or not? Here.
    </p>

    <p class="direction">(Joey reluctantly gives him the cigarette.)</p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> Don't think of it as a cigarette.
      Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're
      holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.
    </p>

    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Joey</span> Y'miss it?</p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> Nah, not so much. Alright, now we
      smoke. (Takes a puff.) Oh.. my.. God. (He continues to smoke.)
    </p>

    <p class="scene">
      [Scene, Central Perk, everyone except Phoebe and Rachel is there.]
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> No, no, no. They say it's the same
      as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index
      finger.
    </p>

    <p class="direction">(The guys stretch out their fingers.)</p>

    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Joey</span> That's ridiculous!</p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> Can I use.. either thumb?
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Rachel</span> (carrying a tray of drinks) Alright,
      don't tell me, don't tell me! (Starts handing them out.) Decaf cappucino
      for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good
      at this!
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">All</span> Yeah. Yeah, excellent.
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Rachel</span> (leaving to serve others) Good for
      me!
    </p>

    <p class="direction">
      (The gang swaps all the drinks for what they ordered as Phoebe enters. She
      sits down without saying hi.)
    </p>

    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Joey</span> Y'okay, Phoebe?</p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Phoebe</span> Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't
      worked- It's my bank.
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> What did they do to you?
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Phoebe</span> It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm
      going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-
    </p>

    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Ross</span> Easy.</p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Phoebe</span> - and there's five hundred extra
      dollars in my account.
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> Oh, Satan's minions at work
      again...
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Phoebe</span> Yes, 'cause now I have to go down
      there, and deal with them.
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Joey</span> What are you talking about? Keep it!
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Phoebe</span> It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if
      I kept it, it would be like stealing.
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Rachel</span> Yeah, but if you spent it, it would
      be like shopping!
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Phoebe</span> Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a
      really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I
      took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and,
      and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'...
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> We're with you. We got it.
    </p>

    <p class="direction">
      (Chandler leans over the back of the couch out of sight.)
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Phoebe</span> Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able
      to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Rachel</span> Chandler, what are you doing?
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> (puling him up) Hey. Whaddya doing?
    </p>

    <p class="direction">
      (Chandler tries to shrug nonchalantly but eventually he has to exhale a
      mouthful of smoke.)

    <p class="speech"><span class="character">All</span> Oh! Oh, God!</p>

    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Ross</span> What is this?!</p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm
      smoking.
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Phoebe</span> Oh, I can't believe you! You've been
      so good, for three years!
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> And this- is my reward!
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> Hold on a second, alright? Just think
      about what you went through the last time you quit.
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> Okay, so this time I won't quit!
    </p>

    <p class="speech"><span class="character">All</span> Ohhh! Put it out!</p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> All right! I'm putting it out, I'm
      putting it out. (He drops it in Phoebe's coffee.)
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Phoebe</span> Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now!
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've
      got a date.
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Rachel</span> This Alan again? How's it goin'?
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> 'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's
      nice, and, we're having fun.
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Joey</span> So when do we get to meet the guy?
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> Let's see, today's Monday... Never.
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">All</span> Oh, come on! Come on!
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> No. Not after what happened with
      Steve.
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> What are you talking about? We
      love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> Look, I don't even know how I feel
      about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Rachel</span> Well, then can we meet him?
    </p>

    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Monica</span> Nope. Schhorry.</p>

    <p class="scene">[Scene: Iridium, Monica and Paula are at work.]</p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> I mean, why should I let them meet
      him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over
      him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the
      herd.
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Paula</span> Listen. As someone who's seen more
      than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a
      terrible thing. I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out
      after you.
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> I know. I just wish that once, I'd
      bring a guy home that they actually liked.
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Paula</span> Well, you do realise the odds of that
      happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..

      <span class="character">Ross</span> Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.
