      <span class="character">Chandler</span> How did the job stuff go?

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Rachel</span> He offered me one.

      <span class="character">Ross</span>
      <span class="direction">(gasps)</span> You know what? This calls for a
      bottle of Israels finest.

      <span class="character">Rachel</span> The job is in Paris.
      <span class="direction">(we see Ross stare in disbelief)</span>

    <p class="scene">FADE OUT</p>

      <span class="character">Rachel</span> Oh, God! Please, somebody say
      something.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> So if you take this job you'll be
      moving to Paris?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> Or facing a bitch of a commute.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Rachel</span> I know, it's huge, and it's scary,
      and it's... really far, far away from you guys, but this is such an
      incredible opportunity for me. And I've already talked to them about our
      situation with Emma, and they said they'll do whatever we need to make us
      feel comfortable.
    </p>
    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Ross</span> Okay.</p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Rachel</span> I mean, I'll fly back and forth,
      they'll fly you out... <em>Anything</em> we want.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> My boss said I might be getting a
      new lamp in my cubicle.

      <span class="character">Rachel</span> Thank you! Thank you!

      <span class="character">Rachel</span> I <em>think</em> it is.

    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Rachel</span> I got a really incredible job offer.

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Joey</span> Hey, great! All right!
    </p>
    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Phoebe</span> Good for you!</p>
    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Rachel</span> It's in Paris.</p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Joey</span> What? No, no, no! No, no... no... no,
      no... No, too much is changing, okay? First, Phoebe getting married
      <span class="direction">(to Phoebe)</span> Congratulations!
      <span class="direction">(pointing to Monica and Chandler)</span>... and
      then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid suburbs...
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> Hey, this afternoon you said you'd
      be supportive...
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Joey</span> Well, it comes and goes. I wouldn't
      trust it.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Rachel</span> Look, you guys... this is really,
      really important to me. And it means a lot if you could try to get on
      board.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Phoebe</span> Of course we can. Congratulations.
      <span class="direction">(they hug, but Joey shakes his head.)</span> Yay!
      <span class="direction">(she gestures Joey to come and join in)</span>
      Joey...
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Joey</span> No, no, no. My hugs are reserved for
      people STAYING IN AMERICA.

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Rachel</span>
      <span class="direction">(walking towards Joey)</span> Joey, it would mean
      so...
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Joey</span> Hey! No! Get your France-going-arms
      away from me.
      <span class="direction">(He walks out, and Rachel follows him)</span>
    </p>
    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Rachel</span> Joey...</p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Phoebe</span> You okay with this?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> Well, it makes me feel sad, but...
    </p>
    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Phoebe</span> Talking to Ross.</p>
    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Chandler</span> I see.</p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> Well, Rachel moving to another
      country? Not being able to see her every day. How can I be okay with this?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> I know, but what are we gonna do?
      She really needs this job.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> Do you think if the Ralph Lauren
      people offered her her old job back, she would take it?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> How is that gonna happen?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> Is this the best way to use one of
      your three magic wishes?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> I don't know. I could talk to her
      boss. Yeah! I met him at that Christmas party. We really hit it off.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> You mean the guy who kept calling
      you Ron?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> I didn't say we were brothers.

      Central Perk. Phoebe's reading a newspaper. Chandler and Monica walk in.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you
      think. All right. The house next door to the one that we're buying in
      Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna take a look at it, but
      Chandler doesn't.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> We close escrow tomorrow, so
      seeing another house can only confuse us, and we're easily confused. We're
      not very bright.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> But what if it is better than ours?
      Should we at least look?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> What do you think Pheebs?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Phoebe</span> Well, I think that shirt makes you
      look like you should work at a Baskin Robbins... Anyway... Hey, isn't
      Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?
    </p>
    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Chandler</span> Yeah.</p>
    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Phoebe</span> She died.</p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> You're kidding!
    </p>
    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Monica</span> That's terrible!</p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Phoebe</span> Yeah, last Saturday. Wow! She was
      the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic.
      <span class="direction">(Chandler and Monica look puzzled)</span> Oh, wait
      a minute, I read the wrong one.
    </p>
    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Chandler</span> Oh yeah?</p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Phoebe</span> Yeah, she was just an agent.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> Joey's gonna be *so* upset.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> I know. *He* always wanted to be
      the first black man to cross the Atlantic.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Phoebe</span> Well, we cannot tell Joey about
      this. He's already flipping out about everything that's changing. This
      will push him over the edge.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> Seriously, you don't think we should
      tell him?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Phoebe</span> Well, not for a little while. Let's
      just give him a few days to get used to everything else.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> What if he reads it in the paper?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie
      Brown, I think we're okay.<br />

      Ralph Lauren. Mr Zelner's office. Ross knocks on the door and enters.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Mr Zelner</span> May I help you?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> Yeah, I'm a friend of Rachel Green's.
      Uhm, actually we met at the Christmas party about two years ago.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Mr Zelner</span> Oh right, uhm, Don?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Mr Zelner</span> Uh... What can I do for you?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> Uhm, well... I'm here to see if you'll
      give Rachel her job back.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Mr Zelner</span> Ah, did she ask you to come here
      and do this?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> Oh, no. At first I have to get you to
      agree. Then we'll see if she <em>wants</em> to come back.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Mr Zelner</span> Wow, that <em>is</em> tempting.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> Look, she <em>loved</em> her job here.
      And let's face it: you're not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she
      did it. Isn't that true?
    </p>
    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Mr Zelner</span> She is good!</p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span>
      <span class="direction">(surprised)</span> Huh, I took a shot there.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Mr Zelner</span> But I'm sorry. There's nothing I
      can do... Ah, it's not true, there is... nothing I <em>want</em> to do.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> I see... Thanks very much.
      <span class="direction"
        >(he gets up and walks to the door. On his way out he looks at the
        photographs Mr Zelner has near his door. He picks one up.)</span

      Is this your son?<br />
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Mr Zelner</span> Yeah, his name is Ross.
      <span class="direction">(Ross looks very surprised)</span> What?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> Oh, nothing, it&#8217;s just,
      it&#8217;s close to Ron. Does he.. Does little Ross like dinosaurs by any
      chance?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Mr Zelner</span> Yeah, they're all he talks about,
      why?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> How would <em>he</em> like to come
      with me to the Museum of Natural History after everyone else has left,
      just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants.
      <span class="direction">(Mr. Zellner looks shocked)</span>. I just heard
      it as you must have heard it and that&#8217;s not good. Let me start
      again. I&#8217;m a paleontologist, you&#8217;ll be there with us and the
      touching refers only to bones&#8230; fossils!
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Mr Zelner</span> You can really arrange that?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> You let Rachel come back, and
      it&#8217;s done.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Mr Zelner</span> Well, I guess having Rachel back
      wouldn&#8217;t be the worst thing in the world.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great.
      Thank you so much. And I swear, your kid is going to have the time of his
      life.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Mr Zelner</span> That&#8217;s great. I worry about
      little Ross. He&#8217;s always reading, he's collecting rocks and
      he&#8217;s obsessed with dinosaurs.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> He&#8217;ll be fine.<br />

      <span class="character">Phoebe</span> Hey. Everything ok?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Joey</span> I&#8217;m just mad at my agent.
    </p>
    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Phoebe</span> Estelle? Why?</p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Joey</span> There&#8217;s a part in a TV movie
      that I would be perfect for and I didn&#8217;t even be put up for it!
      She&#8217;d better have a good reason.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Phoebe</span> I&#8217;m guessing she does.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Joey</span> Well
      <span class="direction">(taking his cell phone out of a pocket)</span>
      I&#8217;m wanna hear it, because she keeps doing this.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Phoebe</span> Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. All
      right, I gotta go. Just listen. Promise me, that you will wait a minute
      before you call her.
    </p>
    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Joey</span> Ok. Why?</p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Phoebe</span> Because a promise between friends
      means never having to give a reason. (she leaves)
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Joey</span> I love that saying!
    </p>
    <p>

      call. Joey is inside, and his mobile phone starts ringing).

      <span class="character">Phoebe (doing Estelle)</span> Joey, it&#8217;s
      Estelle.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Joey</span> I was just gonna call you!
      That&#8217;s weird.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Phoebe-Estelle</span> It&#8217;s a little
      coincidental, but believable.
      <span class="direction">(Joey nods in agreement)</span> Listen, I&#8217;m
      sure you&#8217;re wondering why I didn&#8217;t get you an audition for
      that TV movie.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Joey</span> Yeah, actually I am!
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Phoebe-Estelle </span>I guess I dropped the ball
      there. Whoopsie!
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Joey</span> That&#8217;s it? You know, it seems
      all you do lately is drop the ball.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Phoebe-Estelle</span> Don&#8217;t take that tone
      with me. Who you think you are? Alan Lemond, the first black man to fly
      solo across the Atlantic?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Joey</span> No, no, look. All I&#8217;m saying is
      that you&#8217;re my agent, ok? And you&#8217;re not getting me into any
      auditions and I&#8217;m tired of it.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Phoebe-Estelle</span> What are you saying?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Joey</span> I&#8217;m saying that&#8230; (pause).
      This isn't working for me anymore, ok? Estelle, you&#8217;re fired.
      Goodbye. (he hangs up the phone).

      this house too? Ooh! Are we gonna have a bidding war? I'd better warn you,

      other couple will.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> The only way that that is going to

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> (Thinks a little more) Okay, Okay,
      (clapping her hands) All right. What if we got both houses? Huh? We can
      turn <em>this</em> house into a guest house.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> That is a great idea! And by the
      way, I don't mean to sound distasteful, but when did you start crapping
      money!?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> Okay, you come up with an idea.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> Alright alright, we still have
      three hours till escrow closes on our house. We can still get out.

    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> Okay, but if we don't get this
      house, she's stil gonna show up wherever we go! I mean, at least if she's
      here, it eliminates the element of suprise. I mean, never again will you
      have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your
