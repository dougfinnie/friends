    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Joey</span> I have an audition for this play and
      for some of it I have to speak French. Which, according to my

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> Joey, you shouldn't lie on your

    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> Yeah, you really shouldn't. (to
      Ross, sarcastically) By the way, how was that year-long dig in Cairo?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> (whispering) It was ok...
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Rachel</span> I did not know you spoke French.

    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> I'm making cookies for Erica. And
      oh, by the way, we have to leave for the airport soon, her plane comes in
      about an hour.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it
      ok if I introduce you two as &quot;my wife&quot; and &quot;the woman who's
      carrying my child&quot;? (she's not amused) No? Divorce?

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> No, we haven't seen her since this
      morning.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> So unbelievable. She was supposed to
      meet me half an hour ago with Emma. (he tries to take a cookie but Monica
      slaps his hand)

      <span class="character">Ross</span> What? She's gonna eat

      <span class="character">Monica</span> Well, I want he baby to come out all
      cute and fat!
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> So, why is Erica coming to visit?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> Well, because we want to get to know
      her better and she's never been to New York so she wants to see all the
      tourists' spots... you know, Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building...
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> Oh, those places! There's always
      so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know,
      there's always some idiot who goes &quot;Mooooo&quot;!
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Monica</span> Well, if it annoys you so much, then
      why do you do it?

    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> (looking at Rachel entering with Emma)
      Oh, hi! Hi! Thanks for showing you up <em>thirty minutes</em> late!
    </p>
    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Rachel</span> Ross...</p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> No, no, no, I'm sure you have a great
      excuse, wh-was it a hair appointment, a mani-pedi or was there a sale at
      Barney's?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Rachel</span> My father had an heart attack...
      (crying) ...while I was at Barney&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Ross</span> Oh my God.</p>
    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Monica</span> Honey.</p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Chandler</span> I'm so sorry...
    </p>
    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Ross</span> Is-is he ok?</p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Rachel</span> Yeah, they said he's gonna be fine,
      but he's still heavily sedated.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> Ok, ok. I'm gonna come out to Long
      Island with you, I mean, you can't be alone right now.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Rachel</span> No, come on, I'm totally ok.
      (hugging him) I don't need you to come! I can totally handle this on my
      own.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> Still-still, let me come... for
      <em>me</em>.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Rachel</span> Ok. If you really need to.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Ross</span> I bet someone could use one of
      Monica's freshly baked cookies.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Rachel</span> Oh, I really could.
    </p>
    <p class="speech"><span class="character">Ross</span> Oh!</p>
    <p class="speech">
      <span class="character">Rachel</span> Ohh... (Ross mouths HA-HA at Monica

      him, but he ducks and avoids her more than once.) Oh, oh. (he then hugs
      her and when she tries to kiss him again, he stands up and she falls down
      on the bed). No, Rach! I'm sorry, I just don't think this, this, this is a

      right, I'd feel like I'd be, you know, taking advantage of you.
